# ‚ú® Features

- **Design your very own skins for Minecraft**

  One of the keys to Minecraft‚Äôs success has to do with the fact that players can customize and modify the environment however they like. Thus, why not do the same with the characters they play with? That‚Äôs the function of a program of the likes of MCSkinn, a tool that allows us to create Minecraft skins.

>[!NOTE]
> We also provide various of [tutorials](https://docs.inkore.net/mcskinn/tutorials), [knowledge](https://docs.inkore.net/mcskinn/knowledge) and [tips](https://docs.inkore.net/mcskinn/tips-n-tricks) for you to use in our documentation. Use them flexiblely to create a better authoring environment.

- **Paint all just the way you like the best**

  Unlike other real-time editors, this editor actually lets you paint on the model, as well as the 2d texture map, also providing a neat management facility for all of your installed skins.

- **Organize your wardrobe as well**

  It‚Äôs both a skin management and skin editing tool. It holds all of your skins in a convenient place, lets you manage them from within the program.

- **Create your skin everywhere** (Coming soon)

  You can create your skin almost everywhere with our brand-new editor which is based on web. It is still a work in progress, but you can contribute or sponsor us to help with our development.
